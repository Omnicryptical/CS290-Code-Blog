            The one that I'm most proud of is probably a UI I wrote in React during my internship this last summer for creating filters over AWS cloud resource interactions.
            Basically the user needed to specify AWS interactions that were "security sensitive", and the UI would allow them to combine properties of interactions using boolean operations.
            I defined the UI recursively so that it could handle boolean combinations as large and deeply-nested as the user wants.

        <h3>What do you hope to learn from this class?</h3>
        <p>
            I want to solidify my knowledge of web development. I'm mostly self-taught and so despite being able to do the stuff I want to do for the most part, I have some interesting holes in my knowledge.
            For example, until a recent lecture, I was unclear about the relationship between CSS and HTML, and I thought that CSS was just a niche add-on to make it easier for structures defined in HTML to look good.

            I used to work on an online game whose backend server was written in Haskell. 
            This was a shocking experience for me, someone who had never heard of Haskell before that.
            Me and Haskell are friends now, but that first week got me into David Goggins motivation videos.
