        <h3>Assignment 3 - Javascript</h3>
        <p>11/07/2022</p>
        <p>
            I like Javascript, it's always been the language where I've made the fewest dumb mistakes. Which I think
            speaks more to the kind of programs I write in Javascript than it does of the language itself, but still,
            I feel good after I've written Javascript.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think the biggest insight from this assignment was the realization that the list of elements that you
            get from calling <em>.getElementsByClass</em> or something similar is not an actual array. It's also very
            cool to see some real HTML code written by someone who knows what they're doing, since most of my HTML
            is not so well organized.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, the lecture notes where the most essential for me in completing this assignment, since they had
            all the information I needed on DOM manipulation. I have done a lot of Javascript programming before, so
            a lot of this was familiar to me, but it was interesting nonetheless.

        <h3>Assignment 2 - CSS</h3>
        <p>10/24/2022</p>
        <p>
            This assignment was definitely more interesting than the last one.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think my biggest limiting factor when completing this assignment was not having enough faith in my 
            understanding of CSS. I'm reminded of a common phrase from medical drama TV shows: If you
            hear the clop of hooves, think horses, not zebras. I was looking for zebras because I thought I didn't understand,
            while in reality I had just mistaken an id for a class and some of my changes weren't actually applying.
        </p>
        <p>
            If I counted the number of times I've learned this exact lesson before, I would be good at counting, 
            but not at learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            I did learn about flexboxes for the first time while working on this assignment. It is good that I've finally
            actually learned this, because I worked with flexboxes a lot during my internship this last summer, and that
            code, borne out of trial-and-error, is currently running in production somewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            In terms of useful resources, the lecture notes were invaluable, and were my main reference for completing this. 
            One thing I had to Google was how to center the images, and that ended up being a simple 
            <strong>margin: auto;</strong>
        </p>
        <h3>Assignment 1 - The Beginning of Something Great</h3>
        <p>10/10/2022</p>
        <p>
            This assignment wasn't too bad. I think this is the first time I've ever completed a computer science assignment without having to reference Google.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other than that, two things happened that are noteworthy: 
            <ol>
                <li>
                    VS Code has some nice autocomplete features for HTML that made this a lot easier. I was able to focus on typing the sentences rather than doing finger acrobatics to reach the triangle brackets and the shift key at the same time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I tried to make a commit containing nothing for a good bit, because I'd forgotten to add the new files to git. I'm beginning to think I will never not make this mistake, but the issue is resolved.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
