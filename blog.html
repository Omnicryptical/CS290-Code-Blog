            This assignment wasn't too bad. I think this is the first time I've ever completed a computer science assignment without having to reference Google.

            Other than that, two things happened that are noteworthy: 
            <ol>
                <li>
                    VS Code has some nice autocomplete features for HTML that made this a lot easier. I was able to focus on typing the sentences rather than doing finger acrobatics to reach the triangle brackets and the shift key at the same time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I tried to make a commit containing nothing for a good bit, because I'd forgotten to add the new files to git. I'm beginning to think I will never not make this mistake, but the issue is resolved.
                </li>
            </ol>
