        <h3>Assignment 5 - Express Serving & Handlebar Templates</h3>
        <p>11/14/2022</p>
        <p>
            I have never used anything like handlebar templates before, so this was interesting for me. It struck
            me as weird that we used the logic contained in the handlebar library to display multiple posts rather
            than generating them on the client side like what happens when we create a new post. Maybe I thought this
            becuase I figured we'd have more control in the client-side javascript than in the handlebar templates,
            but we have about the same level of control from the server-side javascript. Besides, this reminds me of
            something my boss once told me: as a general principle, as much logic should be kept from the client side
            as is humanly possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once again, the most valuable resource was the course notes, since these basically went over each piece of
            the assignment step-by-step. Apart from that, I had to go back and look at the <em>fs</em> documentation
            to remember how to use that, but it was mostly smooth sailing I think, assuming I didn't miss something big.
        </p>
        <h3>Assignment 4 - Node.js</h3>
        <p>11/14/2022</p>
        <p>
            This assignment wasn't terribly difficult. I was lucky and I implemented basically the same project
            in C++ last week as part of a hobby project, so I already had a rough idea of how the server should 
            work. The main resources I used to orient myself were the example code from class - which let me know
            roughly which library functions would be useful in which places - and the lecture notes. I also had to
            check the documentation on nodejs.org for a couple of things with the filesystem callback, but I didn't
            run into anything terribly confusing.
        </p>
        <p>
            One thing that I did that may have been less that ideal is I implemented the cache by treating the urls
            as object field names and storing the file data as object fields with those names. This might be bad
            if objects have any kind of field that should not be overwritten. If they exist, I don't think
            they'd be accessible from the url bar due to being prefixed by a '/', but depending on the filtering
            done by the 'http' library in Node, it might be possible that someone could construct a url that would
            behave badly when used to index an object.
        </p>
        <h3>Assignment 3 - Javascript</h3>
        <p>11/07/2022</p>
        <p>
            I like Javascript, it's always been the language where I've made the fewest dumb mistakes. Which I think
            speaks more to the kind of programs I write in Javascript than it does of the language itself, but still,
            I feel good after I've written Javascript.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think the biggest insight from this assignment was the realization that the list of elements that you
            get from calling <em>.getElementsByClass</em> or something similar is not an actual array. It's also very
            cool to see some real HTML code written by someone who knows what they're doing, since most of my HTML
            is not so well organized.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, the lecture notes where the most essential for me in completing this assignment, since they had
            all the information I needed on DOM manipulation. I have done a lot of Javascript programming before, so
            a lot of this was familiar to me, but it was interesting nonetheless.
        </p>
        <h3>Assignment 2 - CSS</h3>
        <p>10/24/2022</p>
        <p>
            This assignment was definitely more interesting than the last one.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think my biggest limiting factor when completing this assignment was not having enough faith in my 
            understanding of CSS. I'm reminded of a common phrase from medical drama TV shows: If you
            hear the clop of hooves, think horses, not zebras. I was looking for zebras because I thought I didn't understand,
            while in reality I had just mistaken an id for a class and some of my changes weren't actually applying.
        </p>
        <p>
            If I counted the number of times I've learned this exact lesson before, I would be good at counting, 
            but not at learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            I did learn about flexboxes for the first time while working on this assignment. It is good that I've finally
            actually learned this, because I worked with flexboxes a lot during my internship this last summer, and that
            code, borne out of trial-and-error, is currently running in production somewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            In terms of useful resources, the lecture notes were invaluable, and were my main reference for completing this. 
            One thing I had to Google was how to center the images, and that ended up being a simple 
            <strong>margin: auto;</strong>
        </p>
        <h3>Assignment 1 - The Beginning of Something Great</h3>
        <p>10/10/2022</p>
        <p>
            This assignment wasn't too bad. I think this is the first time I've ever completed a computer science assignment without having to reference Google.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other than that, two things happened that are noteworthy: 
            <ol>
                <li>
                    VS Code has some nice autocomplete features for HTML that made this a lot easier. I was able to focus on typing the sentences rather than doing finger acrobatics to reach the triangle brackets and the shift key at the same time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I tried to make a commit containing nothing for a good bit, because I'd forgotten to add the new files to git. I'm beginning to think I will never not make this mistake, but the issue is resolved.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </body>
