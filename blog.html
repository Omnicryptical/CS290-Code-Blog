        <h3>Assignment 2 - CSS</h3>
        <p>10/24/2022</p>
        <p>
            This assignment was definitely more interesting than the last one.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think my biggest limiting factor when completing this assignment was not having enough faith in my 
            understanding of CSS. I'm reminded of a common phrase from medical drama TV shows: If you
            hear the clop of hooves, think horses, not zebras. I was looking for zebras because I thought I didn't understand,
            while in reality I had just mistaken an id for a class and some of my changes weren't actually applying.
        </p>
        <p>
            If I counted the number of times I've learned this exact lesson before, I would be good at counting, 
            but not at learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            I did learn about flexboxes for the first time while working on this assignment. It is good that I've finally
            actually learned this, because I worked with flexboxes a lot during my internship this last summer, and that
            code, borne out of trial-and-error, is currently running in production somewhere.
        </p>

            In terms of useful resources, the lecture notes were invaluable, and were my main reference for completing this. 
            One thing I had to Google was how to center the images, and that ended up being a simple 
            <strong>margin: auto;</strong>
        </p>
        <h3>Assignment 1 - The Beginning of Something Great</h3>
        <p>10/10/2022</p>
        <p>
            This assignment wasn't too bad. I think this is the first time I've ever completed a computer science assignment without having to reference Google.
        </p>

            Other than that, two things happened that are noteworthy: 
            <ol>
                <li>
                    VS Code has some nice autocomplete features for HTML that made this a lot easier. I was able to focus on typing the sentences rather than doing finger acrobatics to reach the triangle brackets and the shift key at the same time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I tried to make a commit containing nothing for a good bit, because I'd forgotten to add the new files to git. I'm beginning to think I will never not make this mistake, but the issue is resolved.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
